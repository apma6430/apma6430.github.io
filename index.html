  <strong><b>Course Description: </b></strong>
          <p>What are the contributing factors to the severity of train accidents? How do you predict if an e-mail is spam? How can you translate goal-directed problems such as these into actionable decisions and meaningful recommendations that can have vast societal implications? How can you harness multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data to analyze the problem? In this course, we will explore Evidence Informed Systems Engineering (EISE) practices and how they can be applied to difficult, open-ended problems.<br />
          <br />The primary tools for EISE come from linear statistical models and this course demonstrates the use of these models for problem understanding, prediction, and control. Specific topics include data visualization, principal components, confidence intervals, regression, analysis of variance and covariance, and generalized linear models.<br />

        <h6><i>Required Software</i></h6>
          <p>In this course, we will use R for data analysis. You can use the basic R (RB) or R-Studio (RS) interface. You may request permission to use other software, such as, S+ and SAS but the resulting models, analysis, and graphics in your reports must be comparable to the output we could obtain using R.

  <strong><b>Grading: </b></strong> 
        <!--To be announced officially on first day of class. -->
        <ul> 
          <li>Labs: 40% </li>
          <li>Assignments: 20%</li>
          <li>Midterm Exam: 20%</li>
          <li>Final Exam  20%</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
  
      <p id="labs" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Labs : </b></strong>
        <p>The Labs consist of multiple choice questions that encourage and assess understanding of data analysis and R programming as discussed in the course material. These exercises must be submitted individually and include an honor pledge. However, you are encouraged to work with others on the completion of these exercises.</p>
      </p>
  
      <p id="hands-on activities" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Assignments: </b></strong>
        <p>Assignments that provide open-ended problem solvingexperiences that illustrate the concepts of evidence-informed systems engineering. Hence, they provide the opportunity to demonstrate understanding of class material using real data to solve a goal-directed problem. Assignments are designed to teach students how to perform a detailed analysis as well as how to proficiently communicate results as in a technical document or client report.</p>
<ul> 
  <li><i>R Markdown Notebooks:</i> Each assignment requires you to complete an individual R Markdown Notebook detailing your analysis and communicating your results. The format for each Notebook will be released for each homework. Be sure to reference all material used to complete the homework.</li>
          <li><i>Submission:</i> On the day an assignment is due you must submit an electronic copy of your R Markdown Notebook as well as a <b>PDF (NOT doc or docx, etc.)</b> version of the R Markdown Notebook on the Collab site and pledge your submission. The due dates and times for all assignments will be announced / posted on Collab. Only the instructor can grant exceptions to the due dates and this will normally be done in response to requests made prior to the due date or for true emergencies. Assignments submitted late will be penalized. In many cases you will do better to submit an incomplete assignment rather than a late one.</li>
        </ul>      
</p>

  
      <p id="projects" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Exams: </b></strong>
<p>The exams (one midterm and one final) are based entirely on classroom notes, readings, laboratory exercises, and laboratory sessions. The exams will contain a closed book section, on your honor, with short answer questions and an open book section requiring analytical problem solving.Example questions will be provided before the exams.</p>

  <hr>
       <p id="submission" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Honor Policies: </b></strong> 
        <p>For exams, you may only consult the instructor and teaching assistants. You may not work with others on these assignments.</p>
      <p>For assignments, you may consult others in the class. However, the work you submit must be your own. You may not copy the work of anyone else. Cited material must be properly referenced. If you have questions, consult the course instructor or teaching assistants.</p>
      <p><b><i>If you cheat, copy from someone else on an exam or quiz, or copy someone else's work on a project that you do not cite, then you will fail the course.</b></i></p>
      <p>Every assignment must include an acknowledgment that you abided by the honor code. Failure to include this acknowledgment will mean that your submission will not be graded.</p>
      </p>
      <p id="recording" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Learning Accommodations: </b></strong>
        <p>All students with special needs requiring accommodations should present the appropriate paperwork from the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC). It is the student's responsibility to present this paperwork in a timely fashion and to follow up with the instructor about the accommodations being offered. Accommodations for test-taking (e.g., extended time) should be arranged at least <b>5 days</b> before an exam.</p>
<p>The SDAC is located in the Department of Student Health and can be contacted at 243-5180/5181.</p>
      </p>
      <p id="integrity" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Religious Accommodations: </b></strong> 
        <p>It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing directly to me as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu or 434-924-3200.</p>
      </p>
     
      <p id="discrimination" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Discrimination and power-based violence:</b></strong>
        <p>The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important:(1)Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated. (2)Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds. </p>
      </p>

        <p>If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">https://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.As your professors and as persons, know that we care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as we can. As a faculty member, we are a responsible employee, which means that we are required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you wish to report something that you have seen, you can do so at the <a href="http://justreportit.virginia.edu/">Just Report It</a> portal. The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help.</p>
